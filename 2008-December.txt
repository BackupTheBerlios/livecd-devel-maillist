Subject: [Livecd-devel] Patch for making mklivecd work with Mandriva 2009.0
Message-ID: <4941192E.3080505@onepointltd.com>

I have made some changes to the CVS version of mklivecd so that it works 
with Mandriva 2009.0. I am posting them in case PCLinuxOS inherits any 
of the same changes, such as the new way of starting udev.

I have made it Mandriva specific in that it defaults to the Mandriva 
theme etc so I don't expect it to be integrated as-is. It's just for 
other developers to have a look at in case any of it is useful in the 
future.

Patch attached (if Mailman removes it then I will repost with the patch 
in-line)

Regards,
SimonB
