Subject: Re: [Livecd-users] new developer

Glad to see this group is still alive, LOL.

Anyway, I would like to see an option in mklivecd that
would allow one to install the created iso directly
rather than have to boot from it into livecd mode.
then install.

Is an option like this going to be available in future
releases or is it up to the hosting distro to create this?

Best Regards
Vampirefo

hi

The option you're referring to is rather a boot option more than a 
livecd option and the the overall task you're wishing to see endorsed by 
the livecd tools isn't (as far as i can tell) possible. in other word, 
it's possible to boot/start an x server then directly go to the install 
section or to the desktop mode with livecd... other features are just 
not livecd ...

So yest it's likely to be done with livecd and eventually with an option 
from the livecd initial boot screen (grub?) and with custom boot image 
to go right away into install mode without a &quot;live&quot; desktop loggin or to 
mockup a minimal gui loading like for drak3d and install with a loggin 
screen hack ... but that would be in my very opinion against the livecd 
philosophy itself.

It doesn't sounds to me that there is anything to be added to the livecd 
framework to do this, but rather something to be hacked in from the &quot;pre 
remaster&quot; state of the system in order to allow this !

Something else ...

Since you wrote a gui to mklivecd too ... why don't you join gri in the 
developement of his gui (perl/tk) and the port of it to perl/gtk and 
maybe a blend with yours

anyways i will forward this message to the livecd developer list.

thanks for your input.

DidouPh
