Hi all

I want to point you to some new tools being developed around mklivecd 
script and livecd framework @ mypclinuxos.com

Remaster GUI is an attempt to give mklivecd a gui front-end to remaster 
for the average joe to be able to remaster/backup his system in no time
http://www.mypclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?board=85.0
(the project just got set-up and is based on this tread : 
http://www.mypclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?topic=1433.0 )

Poor Man's Install Script / Live USB ... is a poorman install project 
aiming to get a usb dongle/key/flash behave like a livecd but with write 
access and change being saved to it ... a real portable OS
http://www.mypclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?board=84.0

Despite the fact that those are hosted on a pclinuxos project site, it 
doesn't mean those are pclinuxos centric or pclinuxos only ... they are 
open and willing for external imput (mandriva ? mcn live ? ... )

thanks for your attention

bye

DidouPh

hi all,

I'd like to introduce Paul Grinberg.
He's the author of the Remaster-gui I recently introduced to you.
He will be implementing this gui as a part of the livecd framework.
Since this gui is a front-end to mklivecd ... there might virtually be 
no reason for the gui code to influence the mklivecd script and 
livecd-utils code.

DidouPh

hi all

this message is more for Ivan, Sal and other pclinuxos developers that
my be able to grant me access to the srpm for the 0.6.0-32 version of
mklivecd as embedded in the testing version of the current mklivecd so i
can add the sources to the CVS and resynch everything ... the last srpm
i could use to get the sources for such update was 0.6.0-22 which is 6
month old ! the current RPM.testing section of the repository refers to
it as being 0.6.0-32 for the latest available but the source rpm isn't
fetchable yet !

thanks for your understanding.

Pierre-Henri

Tex moved a lot of stuff around yesterday and the rpm is now in SRPM.main but 
maybe things haven't syncd yet. I've emailed you the package in any case. ;-)

Subject: Re: [Livecd-users] new developer

Glad to see this group is still alive, LOL.

Anyway, I would like to see an option in mklivecd that
would allow one to install the created iso directly
rather than have to boot from it into livecd mode.
then install.

Is an option like this going to be available in future
releases or is it up to the hosting distro to create this?

Best Regards
Vampirefo

hi

The option you're referring to is rather a boot option more than a 
livecd option and the the overall task you're wishing to see endorsed by 
the livecd tools isn't (as far as i can tell) possible. in other word, 
it's possible to boot/start an x server then directly go to the install 
section or to the desktop mode with livecd... other features are just 
not livecd ...

So yest it's likely to be done with livecd and eventually with an option 
from the livecd initial boot screen (grub?) and with custom boot image 
to go right away into install mode without a "live" desktop loggin or to 
mockup a minimal gui loading like for drak3d and install with a loggin 
screen hack ... but that would be in my very opinion against the livecd 
philosophy itself.

It doesn't sounds to me that there is anything to be added to the livecd 
framework to do this, but rather something to be hacked in from the "pre 
remaster" state of the system in order to allow this !

Something else ...

Since you wrote a gui to mklivecd too ... why don't you join gri in the 
developement of his gui (perl/tk) and the port of it to perl/gtk and 
maybe a blend with yours

anyways i will forward this message to the livecd developer list.

thanks for your input.

DidouPh

Subject: [Livecd-devel] [Bug #3454] Changeing keyboard does not work in
	LiveCD
Message-ID: <200712052328.lB5NS397003216@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #3454, was updated on 2005-Feb-23 12:09
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: LiveCD
Category: mklivecd
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 6
Submitted by: none
Assigned to : none
Summary: Changeing keyboard does not work in LiveCD

Details: The problem is that if you e.g. add the keyboard chooser to kicker in KDE or run the command setxkbmap then you get an error that the keymap can not be loaded.

The reason for this bug is simply because X cannot make a temporary file under /var/lib/xkb/. The permissions here needs to be 0777 or something similar for it to work under runlevel 3.

When running under runlevel 5 however the system tries to find the files from 
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/xkb/
which is (atleast on a Mandrake system) a symlink to:
../../../../etc/X11/xkb/
This should be changed to 
/etc/X11/xkb/
Since the relative link will point to the read only media when running from cd.

The same goes for the link:
/etc/X11/xkb/compiled/
It links to
../../../var/lib/xkb/
But it should be:
/var/lib/xkb/

Not sure if this bug should go to mandrake or if this should be fixed when doing in mklivecd. After changing the two links and the permissions it works just fine on the resulting LiveCD.

For detailed info, follow this link:
