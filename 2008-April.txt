they are none that i know but your implementations would be welcome ...

the latest pclinuxos version contains extra patches that might not be in 
the current release and cvs version

usually all the devs are monitoring this list so you migt be able t 
contact them from here ...

whatever ersion of mklivecd you plan to work on tell me and i will 
update the cvs accordingly. despite the lack of update on the cvs, the 
project is still very active but is released as pclinuxos rpm even if 
its still cross ditribution.

if you can't get your hand on the latest srpm, i will provide you with 
an up to date one

The initrd I'm modifying was generated with 0.7.0, on a PCLinuxOS
derivative, so it should be quite uptodate. I've also got the SRPM
accordingly. No need to rush on updating CVS for now :)

Anyway, I'll currently modifying the initrd by hand (loopback, and a
tiny script to update the files published through tftp), so I don't even
need the whole mklivecd sources. ;)

I'll let you know how far I'm getting, and ask for help if I get stuck,
or provide you with patches once I'm done.

Cheers,

good to hear that someone is willing to add to the script and carry on 
the developement of the features that it is still lacking

anyway working on the latest srpm (testing) is a must for the reason 
that it is very often revised with most vanilla versions.
