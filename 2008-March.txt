Subject: [Livecd-devel] What about NFSRoot ?
Message-ID: <47F0E8FB.2040707@kerlabs.com>

Hi folks,

I'm wondering whether you already thought of implementing nfsroot in
your tool, so that the generated initrd would also support booting from
nfs, which mostly means mounting nfs according to some parameters passed
through the boot command-line.

I'm about to implement it myself, but if there were some patches around,
I'd be happy to test and report back.

Cheers,
